| [`@ribbonprotocol/frontend`](https://github.com/RibbonBlockchain/RibbonAppAI)           | Frontend NextJS application that users interact with. [Link](https://ribbon-app-ai-phi.vercel.app)                             |
| [`@ribbonprotocol/admin-panel`](https://github.com/RibbonBlockchain/RibbonAdminPanelAI) | Frontend NextJS application for admin management.                                                                              |

Each section has it's own repository and has it's own readme within the package that explains how to set it up and get running with that specific component.

## Requirements

This project requires `node >=18.0.0`, `npm >=10.x.x` and `pnpm >=8.x.x`. A unix shell is also required.

- [Installing Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
- [Installing pnpm](https://pnpm.io/7.x/installation)
- [UNIX Shell (Windows users)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RibbonBlockchain/RibbonAppAI.git
cd RibbonAppAI
pnpm install
```

For development purposes there's a top-level `dev` script that will watch and continuously compile all packages concurrently:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For next steps, take a look at documentation for the individual package(s) you want to run and/or develop. Each package can be run from the root directory using pnpm or npm. The main things you can do are outlined below:

```bash
    pnpm dev       # start the development server/environment
    pnpm build     # run a production build
    pnpm start     # starts the application in a production-like environment
    pnpm lint      # runs a linter on your codebase
```

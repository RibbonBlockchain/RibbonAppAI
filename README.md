Ribbon Protocol is a universal health coverage rewards and loyalty platform that aims to modify health and wellness behavior through incentivization and rewardable tasks.

The Ribbon App intertwines Universal Basic Income with Universal Health Coverage, utilizing World ID users health & socioeconomic data to enhance global well-being. The protocol rewards users for activities that help assess their wellness and socioeconomic needs, while linking them to equitable UBI and personalized services.

Rewards and Incentives are distributed in points and WLD tokens, on the Optimism Mainnet network which is a Layer 2 network of the Ethereum blockchain.

| [`@ribbonprotocol/api`](https://github.com/RibbonBlockchain/RibbonApp-BackEnd)                 | Backend API built with Typescript and NestJS restful API that handles data capture for users and all system wide interactions. |
| [`@ribbonprotoccol/frontend`](https://github.com/RibbonBlockchain/RibbonApp)                   | Frontend NextJS application that users interact with. [Link](https://ribbon-app-ten.vercel.app)                                |
| [`@ribbonprotoccol/admin-panel`](https://github.com/RibbonBlockchain/RibbonAdminPanelFrontEnd) | Frontend NextJS application for admin management.                                                                              |

Each section has it's own repository and has it's own readme within the package that explains how to set it up and get running with that specific component.

## Requirements

This project requires `node >=18.0.0`, `npm >=10.x.x` and `pnpm >=8.x.x`. A unix shell is also required.

- [Installing Node](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
- [Installing pnpm](https://pnpm.io/7.x/installation)
- [UNIX Shell (Windows users)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repo and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RibbonBlockchain/RibbonApp.git
cd RibbonApp
pnpm install
```

For development purposes there's a top-level `dev` script that will watch and continuously compile all packages concurrently:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

For next steps, take a look at documentation for the individual package(s) you want to run and/or develop. Each package can be run from the root directory using pnpm or npm. The main things you can do are outlined below:

```bash
    pnpm dev       # start the development server/environment
    pnpm build     # run a production build
    pnpm start     # starts the application in a production-like environment
    pnpm lint      # runs a linter on your codebase
```

## Deployment
